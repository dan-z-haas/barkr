barkr is my pet project, a companion app for man's companions.  More than social media for dogs - this app makes your pet more accessible to your friends, family, and petsitters at the touch of a button.  Give your dog a brief bio, list the commands they know, easily access local adventures, and make their care idiotproof by noting daily routine, supplies, and emergency contacts.  Imagine your friends can access everything you know about your best friend.

This repository has two versions: 
1) The original bootstrap version created with HTML, CSS, JS, and bootstrap.
2) A prototype react deployment version.  For the code for the finalized react version, see barkr-react repository master branch at https://github.com/dan-z-haas/barkr-react

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy.
